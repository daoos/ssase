SSASE (including SAM, RCA, FEMOSAA and MOACO)
==========

This is the main repository for Search-based Self-Adaptive Software Engine (SSASE), an adaptation engine framework that exploits the advances of search-based software engineering techniques to tackle modelings, architecting and decision making problems for self-adaptive software systems, especially at runtime.

Currently it encapsulates the following sub-frameworks/components:

###SAM: Self-Adaptive Modeling###

This is a framework that enables self-adaptive feature selection and selection of learning algorithms to model the correlation of control features, environments, interference to Quality of Service (QoS) attributes (e.g., response time). More details can be found in the following publications:

###RCA : Region Controlled Architecture (for cloud environment only)###

This is a component that intelligent divide the architecture with respect to objective-dependency, which is determined by the inputs of QoS model.  More details can be found in the following publications:

###FEMOSAA: Feature Guided and Knee Driven Multi-Objective Optimization for Self-Adaptive Software at Runtime 

This is a novel framework that automatically synergizes the feature model and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) to optimize SASâ€™s conflicting QoS objectives at runtime. At design time, FEMOSAA automatically transposes the design of SAS, which is expressed as a feature model, to the chromosome representation and the reproduction operators (mutation and crossover) in MOEA. At runtime, the feature model serves as the domain knowledge to guide the search, providing more chances to find better solutions. FEMOSAA contains a new method to search for the knee solutions, which can achieve balanced trade-off. This work is currently being submitted for publication.

Currently, FEMOSAA exploits the recent MOEA/D variant, MOEA/D-STM, which extends the survival selection of the original MOEA/D. The source code of MOEA/D-STM, our feature dependency aware mutation/crossover operators and knee selection method can be found at [here](https://github.com/JerryI00/Software-Adaptive-System).

### MOACO: Self-Adaptive and Interference-Aware Multi-Objective Ant Colony Optimization for Decision Making in Self-Adaptive Software 

This is a component that exploits multi-objective ant colony algorithm to optimise adaptation decisions for self-adaptive software system at runtime. It particularly considers QoS interference caused by multi-tenants and virtualized environment, e.g. cloud computing. The approach leverage nash dominance, a popular economic principle, to find well-compromised/knee trade-off decisions. More details can be found in the following publications:

For all experiments in the published papers, we have used the following benchmarks and workload trace:

 * RUBiS - we have extended the original RUBiS by installing various sensors, source code can be found at [adaptable-software/rubis/](https://github.com/taochen/ssase/tree/master/adaptable-software/rubis)


 * FIFA98 workload trace - we have extracted and compressed the trace to meet our demand, the files and parsing scripts can be found at http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/WorldCup.html and [fifa98/](https://github.com/taochen/ssase/tree/master/fifa98) respectively.


Note that all the sub-framework/components can be switch off/on in the [ControlBus.java](https://github.com/taochen/ssase/blob/master/src/main/java/org/ssase/ControlBus.java) class. We are in the progress to implement more seamless and flexible to control those components.

The SSASE repository contains a pom.xml for Maven build, but the Ant build file has not yet been completed. Potential users are advised to use Maven for building the project.

To use this framework, the only necessary configurations are the files under [src/main/resources/](https://github.com/taochen/ssase/tree/master/src/main/resources). Those files are explained as below:

 * _dom0.properties_ specifies the port/ip address of the adaptable software. It should be placed with the main framework as an adaptation engine.

 * _dom0.xml_ specifies the control features/primitives, environmental factors and QoS objectives that the users wish to control/manage. It should be placed with the main framework as an adaptation engine.

 * _domU.properties_ specifies the port/ip address of the adaptation engine. It should be placed with the adaptable software.

 * _domU.xml_ specifies the various sensors that are placed with the adaptable software. It should be placed with the main framework as an adaptation engine. It should be placed with the adaptable software. In the future, we will refactor them to be more flexible similar to the installation of sensors.

 * _feature_model.xml_ specifies the control features and their dependency. This will be used by our FEMOSAA framework to perform feature guided multi-objective optimization. We currently only support XML, other formats, e.g., CNF, will be implemented shortly.

We are also in the process to add more exampled scenarios for using SSASE framework. We will update here once they have been completed.
